Bargaining with promises
------------------------

Applying a promise is like taking a hostage. Your demands might be met
in time, but until they are you're sitting around doing nothing other
than guarding a prisoner.

So we don't like to take hostages or apply promises, but what good is
a promise if you can't do anything with its value? Luckily, you can do
plenty. You just have to be flexible about when things happen.

### Transformations

A promise is like an option that doesn't know what it is yet; that
doesn't stop it from promising to transform into something else. We
could map an option of a string into an option of its length. Same
goes for promises.

```scala
import dispatch._
val svc = url("http://api.hostip.info/country.php")
val country = Http(svc OK as.String)
val length = for (c <- country) yield c.length
```
The `length` value is a promise of integer.

### Promise#toString

If you pasted the above into a console, you probably saw something
like this in the output:

    country: dispatch.Promise[String] = Promise(-incomplete-)
    length: dispatch.Promise[Int] = Promise(2)

Both promises depend on the same network operation. By the time the
second is evealuated by the console, its underlying value may or may
not be available.  But if you try a moment or two later, you'll see
that both promises print their values.

    scala> country
    res2: dispatch.Promise[String] = Promise(US)

`Promise.toString` represents promised values only if they are already
available.

### Promise#completeOption

How does `toString` work on unknown values? It uses an option. You can
use the same technique to access the integer value, *if it's
available*.

```scala
val lengthNow = length.completeOption.getOrElse(-1)
```

But most of the time, you want to operate on values that are known to
be available. In the next pages we'll see how far we can go in this
direction by transforming promises.
