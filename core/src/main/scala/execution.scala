 * Singleton helper for vending Http instances.
 *
 * In past versions of Dispatch, this singleon was, itself, an Http executor. That could lead to
 * a few code traps were it was possible to unintentionally allocate additional Http pools without
 * realizing it because `Http.xxxx` and `Http().xxxx` both look very similar - yet do very different
 * things.
 *
 * In the interest of avoiding such code traps in future releases of Dispatch, `Http` was changed
 * to a helper in 0.13.x that is capable of vending a default `Http` executor instance or
 * of configuring a custom one with its `withConfiguration` method.
 *
 * If you relied on the default `Http` instance in your code you can easily port
 * your code to 0.13.x by simply invoking the `Http.default` method. Such as...
 *
 * {{{
 * Http.default(localhost / "split" << Seq("str" -> str) > as.String)
 * }}}
